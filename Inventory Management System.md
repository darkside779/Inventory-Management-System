Core Features of the Inventory Management System
This defines the scope of your project. We'll start with the essentials and include some advanced features you can add later.
User Roles & Permissions:
Administrator: Has full access. Can manage users, warehouses, suppliers, and see all system-wide reports.
Manager: Can manage products, view inventory, and run reports for their assigned warehouse(s). Cannot manage users or system settings.
Staff: Can only process inventory transactions (e.g., record stock in/out) and view current inventory levels.
Main Modules:
Dashboard: A home page showing key metrics at a glance (e.g., total products, low-stock items, recent transactions).
Products Module:
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) products.
Assign products to categories.
Set low-stock alert thresholds for each product.
Inventory Module:
View current stock levels of all products across different warehouses.
Manually adjust stock quantities (with a reason required, e.g., "damage," "recount").
View a detailed history of every transaction for a specific product.
Warehouse Module:
CRUD operations for physical or logical warehouse locations.
Supplier Module:
CRUD operations for suppliers.
Link products to their primary suppliers.
Transactions Module:
Stock In (Purchase Order): Record incoming stock from a supplier.
Stock Out (Shipment/Sale): Record outgoing stock.
Reporting Module:
Generate reports on current inventory value.
List all items below their low-stock threshold.
Generate an inventory transaction history report for a given date range.
User Management Module (Admin only):
CRUD operations for user accounts.
Assign roles to users.
2. Database Schema (for SQL Server 14)
This is the blueprint for your database. You can create these tables directly in SSMS. The [Id] columns are primary keys, and [...Id] columns are foreign keys.
Table Name
Columns
Description
Users
Id (int, PK), Username, PasswordHash, FullName, Role
Stores user login information and their role.
Products
Id (int, PK), Name, SKU, Description, Price, CategoryId, LowStockThreshold
The master list of all products.
Categories
Id (int, PK), Name
Product categories (e.g., "Electronics," "Clothing").
Warehouses
Id (int, PK), Name, Location
The different locations where inventory is stored.
Suppliers
Id (int, PK), Name, ContactInfo, Address
Information about who supplies the products.
Inventory
Id (int, PK), ProductId (FK), WarehouseId (FK), Quantity
Crucial Table: Tracks the quantity of each product in each warehouse.
Transactions
Id (int, PK), ProductId (FK), WarehouseId (FK), QuantityChanged, TransactionType, Timestamp, UserId (FK), Reason
A log of every single inventory movement (in or out).
Relationships:
Products has a one-to-many relationship with Categories.
Inventory has many-to-one relationships with Products and Warehouses. A product can be in many warehouses, and a warehouse can hold many products.
Transactions has many-to-one relationships with Products, Warehouses, and Users.
3. ASP.NET Core Project Structure (Clean Architecture)
For a system of this size, using Clean Architecture is highly recommended. It separates your code into independent layers, making it easier to manage, test, and scale.
Here is the folder structure for your solution:
