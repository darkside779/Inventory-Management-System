## Files Created/Modified

### Application Layer
- `Features/Products/Queries/GetAllProducts/GetAllProductsQuery.cs`
- `Features/Products/Queries/GetProductById/GetProductByIdQuery.cs`
- `Features/Products/Commands/CreateProduct/CreateProductCommand.cs`
- `Features/Products/Commands/UpdateProduct/UpdateProductCommand.cs`
- `Features/Products/Commands/DeleteProduct/DeleteProductCommand.cs`
- `Mappings/MappingProfile.cs` (updated)

### WebUI Layer
- `Controllers/ProductController.cs`
- `ViewModels/Products/ProductIndexViewModel.cs`
- `Views/Product/Index.cshtml`
- `Views/Product/Create.cshtml`
- `Views/Product/Edit.cshtml`
- `Views/Product/Details.cshtml`
- `Views/Product/Delete.cshtml`

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Soft Delete Logic:** Products with existing inventory are soft-deleted; others are hard-deleted
2. **Role-Based Security:** Admin and Manager roles can perform all operations
3. **Validation Strategy:** Client-side and server-side validation with comprehensive error messages
4. **UI/UX Design:** Bootstrap-based responsive design with accessibility features
5. **Transaction History:** Real-time display of recent product transactions

## Business Rules Implemented
- SKU uniqueness validation across active products
- Barcode uniqueness validation (when provided)
- Category and Supplier existence validation
- Stock threshold warnings for low inventory
- Audit trail for all product operations

## Performance Considerations
- Implemented pagination for product listings
- Used eager loading for related entities where appropriate
- Optimized queries with proper indexing support
- Cached category and supplier data for dropdowns
