  - Duplicate validation excluding current record
  - Comprehensive validation rules
  
- **DeleteSupplierCommand**: Soft delete implementation
  - Business rule validation (active products check)
  - Inventory stock validation
  - Recent transactions validation
  - Soft delete via IsActive flag

#### Queries
- **GetAllSuppliersQuery**: Paginated supplier listing
  - Advanced filtering (active only, with products only)

#### Views
- **Index.cshtml**: Advanced supplier listing with:
  - Real-time search and filtering
  - AJAX-powered status toggling
  - Sortable columns with visual indicators
  - Responsive pagination
  - Performance status indicators

- **Create.cshtml**: Supplier creation form with:
  - Client-side validation
  - Dynamic form behavior
  - Comprehensive input validation
  - User-friendly error messaging

- **Edit.cshtml**: Supplier editing interface with:
  - Pre-populated form data
  - Status change warnings
  - Validation feedback
  - Audit trail information

- **Details.cshtml**: Comprehensive supplier overview with:
  - Complete supplier information
  - Product listing with filtering
  - Statistical dashboards
  - Quick action buttons
  - Performance analytics

- **Delete.cshtml**: Deletion confirmation with:
  - Impact assessment
  - Business rule validation warnings
  - Comprehensive safety checks
  - Clear deletion consequences

### 5. Clean Architecture Compliance

#### Repository Pattern Implementation
- Replaced all direct `DbContext` usage in Application layer with `IUnitOfWork`
- Proper dependency injection and interface abstraction
- Generic repository pattern with specialized supplier operations
- Transaction management through UnitOfWork pattern

#### CQRS Pattern
- Clear separation between Commands (write operations) and Queries (read operations)
- Dedicated handlers for each operation
- Proper error handling and validation
- Comprehensive logging throughout

#### Dependency Injection
- Proper DI container configuration
- Interface-based programming
- Service lifetime management
- Clean separation of concerns

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Error Resolution
- Fixed all `_context` usage to use `IUnitOfWork` pattern
- Corrected method signatures for repository calls
- Resolved property name inconsistencies
- Fixed AutoMapper configuration issues
- Resolved controller inheritance and dependency issues

### 2. Code Quality
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Comprehensive input validation
- Proper exception management
- Business rule enforcement
- Security considerations (authorization, validation)

### 3. User Experience
- Intuitive navigation and user interface
- Real-time feedback and validation
- Responsive design principles
- Comprehensive help and guidance
- Performance optimizations
