# TASK 6.6 - Transactions Module Implementation - COMPLETED

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Transactions Module for the Inventory Management System, providing full functionality for managing inventory stock movements including stock in, stock out, and adjustment transactions.

## Completed Features

### 1. Domain Layer Analysis and Integration
- **Transaction Entity**: Analyzed existing `Transaction` entity with properties for product tracking, warehouse management, user attribution, transaction types, quantity changes, unit costs, and timestamps
- **Domain Methods**: Leveraged existing domain validation methods for creating stock in, stock out, and adjustment transactions
- **Inventory Integration**: Successfully integrated with `Inventory` entity using proper domain methods (`AdjustQuantity`, `HasSufficientStock`, etc.)

### 2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- **TransactionDto**: Complete DTO with product, warehouse, user information, transaction details, and navigation properties
- **CreateTransactionDto**: DTO for creating new transactions with validation
- **UpdateTransactionDto**: DTO for updating existing transactions
- **TransactionSummaryDto**: Summary statistics for reporting and analytics
- **TransactionLookupDto**: Simplified DTO for lookups and dropdowns

### 3. CQRS Implementation

#### Queries
- **GetAllTransactionsQuery**: 
  - Advanced filtering by product, warehouse, user, transaction type, date range, and search terms
  - Sorting and pagination support
  - Includes navigation properties (Product, Warehouse, User)
  - Error handling and logging

- **GetTransactionByIdQuery**:
  - Retrieves single transaction with full details
  - Includes all navigation properties
  - Proper error handling for not found scenarios

- **GetTransactionsByProductQuery**:
  - Product-specific transaction history
  - Transaction statistics calculation
  - Filtering and pagination
  - Performance optimized with proper includes

#### Commands
- **CreateStockInTransactionCommand**:
  - Creates stock in transactions with inventory updates
  - Automatic inventory creation if not exists
  - Unit cost tracking and weighted average calculation
  - Domain validation and error handling

- **CreateStockOutTransactionCommand**:
  - Creates stock out transactions with stock validation
  - Checks available stock before processing
  - Updates inventory using domain methods
  - Prevents negative stock scenarios

- **CreateAdjustmentTransactionCommand**:
  - Creates adjustment transactions (positive/negative)
  - Handles inventory creation for new product-warehouse combinations
  - Validation for negative stock prevention
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 4. Web UI Layer

#### Controller
- **TransactionController**: Full CRUD operations with role-based authorization
  - Index: Transaction listing with advanced filtering and pagination
  - Details: Comprehensive transaction view with current inventory status
  - CreateStockIn: Stock in transaction form processing
  - CreateStockOut: Stock out transaction with availability checks
  - CreateAdjustment: Inventory adjustment form processing
  - History: Product transaction history with statistics
  - AJAX endpoints for real-time stock level retrieval

#### ViewModels
- **TransactionIndexViewModel**: Filtering, pagination, and transaction listing
- **CreateStockInViewModel**: Stock in form with validation
- **CreateStockOutViewModel**: Stock out form with current stock display
- **CreateAdjustmentViewModel**: Adjustment form with quantity calculations
- **TransactionDetailsViewModel**: Comprehensive transaction details
- **TransactionHistoryViewModel**: Product transaction history with statistics

#### Razor Views
- **Index.cshtml**: Transaction listing with filters, sorting, and pagination
- **CreateStockIn.cshtml**: Stock in form with total value calculation
- **CreateStockOut.cshtml**: Stock out form with stock availability warnings
- **CreateAdjustment.cshtml**: Adjustment form with quantity impact display
- **Details.cshtml**: Comprehensive transaction details with current inventory status
- **History.cshtml**: Product transaction history with statistics and export options

### 5. AutoMapper Configuration
- **Transaction Mappings**: Complete mapping configuration between Transaction entity and DTOs
- **Property Mappings**: Correct mapping of TransactionType, QuantityChanged, UnitCost, Timestamp, Notes
- **Navigation Properties**: Proper mapping of Product, Warehouse, and User navigation properties
- **Null Handling**: Safe mapping with null checks for optional properties

### 6. Inventory Integration
- **Quantity Updates**: Real-time inventory updates using domain methods
- **Stock Validation**: Proper stock availability checks for stock out operations
- **Inventory Creation**: Automatic inventory record creation for new product-warehouse combinations
- **Domain Compliance**: Uses Inventory entity's domain methods (AdjustQuantity, HasSufficientStock)

### 7. Validation and Business Rules
- **Domain Validation**: Leverages Transaction entity's validation methods
- **Stock Validation**: Prevents negative stock scenarios
- **User Authorization**: Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Employee)
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation attributes on ViewModels
- **Business Rules**: Enforces proper transaction flow and inventory consistency

## Technical Architecture

### Clean Architecture Compliance
- **Domain Layer**: Pure domain logic without external dependencies
- **Application Layer**: CQRS commands/queries with business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access through repository pattern
- **Presentation Layer**: MVC controllers and Razor views

### Design Patterns Used
- **CQRS**: Separate commands and queries for different operations
- **Mediator Pattern**: Using MediatR for decoupled communication
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction through IUnitOfWork
- **DTO Pattern**: Data transfer objects for API boundaries
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain entities with business logic

### Security Features
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Different permissions for Admin, Manager, Employee
- **User Tracking**: All transactions attributed to authenticated users
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-forgery tokens on all forms
